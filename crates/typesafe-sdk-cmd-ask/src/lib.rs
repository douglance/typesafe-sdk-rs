const HINT: &str = "Pick the primitive by what the answer means: --choice for one of a \
defined set, --score for a degree along an ordered dimension, --noul for whether a \
condition holds. Put the judgment in the question and the possible answers in the \
labels; answer names are for your code and are never shown to the model, so each \
question must carry its full meaning. Give it enough state to answer — quote the source \
text rather than summarising it. Ask every independent question in one --questions \
object: they run in parallel and cost one round trip. Read the numbers carefully: a noul \
near 0.5 means the model finds yes and no equally likely, not a medium amount of the \
thing; confidence on a choice or score reports how concentrated the distribution is, not \
whether the answer is correct. Typed output guarantees the shape, never the truth. The live docs are the source of \
truth and worth reading before a first integration: start at \
https://docs.typesafe.ai/llms.txt, then the page for the primitive you chose \
(https://docs.typesafe.ai/primitives/choice.md, /noul.md or /score.md), \
https://docs.typesafe.ai/concepts/state.md for what to put in the question, and \
https://docs.typesafe.ai/confidence.md before you act on a threshold. Append .md to any \
docs path to read it as Markdown.";
