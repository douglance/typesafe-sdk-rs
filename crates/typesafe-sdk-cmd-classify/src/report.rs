//! What a classification run reports.
//!
//! A failed item is a row, not an aborted run: one unclassifiable line in a
//! thousand should not cost the other nine hundred and ninety-nine. The
//! `uncertain` count is the one worth reading first, because a confident wrong
//! answer and an unconfident right one look identical in the labels alone.
//!
//! A batch reports what it cost in total. Per-item tokens are the caller's to
//! attribute; the number anyone actually quotes is the one for the whole run.
