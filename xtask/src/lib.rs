//! Structure, size and complexity gates for the typesafe-sdk workspace.
//!
//! These exist because the alternative does not work. Every repository on this
//! machine that stayed small has a gate like this; the ones that did not have
//! files of three thousand lines and permission checks scattered through them.
//! Intent does not survive a deadline. A failing build does.
//!
//! Gates are pure: they take the tree and return [`Violation`]s. Printing and
//! exiting happen once, at the edge, which keeps every rule testable.
